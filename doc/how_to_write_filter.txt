  WHITE_LISTER_FILTER_ID,

3) Add the constant filter name in banjax_filter.h, e.g.:

4) write the constructor to set the filter name and id.
5) Override the load_config, execute.
6) if it is needed override generate_response

7) in Banjax::filter_factory add the new name to the loop
8) include the filter header file in banjax.cpp
9) add the cpp file to the Makefile
